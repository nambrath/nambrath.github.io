			I work with <a href="https://physics.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/barbara-jacak">Prof. Barbara Jacak's</a> group at UC Berkeley on projects for the <a href="https://alice-collaboration.web.cern.ch/">ALICE</a> collaboration. My current project is a measurement of energy-energy correlators in p-Pb collisions at ALICE, and I showed some of my early progress at Quark Matter 2023. Before starting the PhD officially, I worked with the group for about six months prior to my Fulbright. Three of those months were spent onsite at CERN in Geneva. I worked on software to streamline calibration for ALICE's Inner Tracking System, and began a project on signatures of hadronization in jet substructure.

	<h2> Electrons for neutrinos </h2>
	<div class="snapshot"> 
		<p class="para">
			I spent two years working with <a href="https://www.hen-lab.com/">Prof. Or Hen's group </a> on the <a href='https://www.hen-lab.com/research-neutrino'>e4nu collaboration</a>. The collaboration is using electron scattering data to improve event generators and energy reconstruction for neutrino oscillation experiments. During the summer of 2019, I interned at Fermilab through the DOE SULI program and tested reconstruction techniques on GENIE simulations. Over 2020 and 2021, I analyzed electron-deuterium interactions for my undergraduate thesis to verify how well these methods work on the simplest nuclei.

	<h2> Axion detection </h2>
	<div class="snapshot"> 
		<p class="para">
			I worked for a semester in 2019 with Prof. Lindley Winslow's group on <a href="http://abracadabra.mit.edu/">ABRACADABRA</a>, a cryogenic search for axion cold dark matter. I worked on characterizing parts of the current detector system as well as performing calculations for an upcoming new version of the detector. In 2021, I worked with <a href="https://katelinschutz.com/">Prof. Katelin Schutz</a> and others at MIT on a study of new methods for detecting axions in the galactic halo using radio telescopes. I contributed to the modeling of proper motion and other galactic effects.

	<h2> Backward Angle Neutron Detector </h2>
	<div class="snapshot"> 
		<p class="para">
			From 2017 to 2018, I worked with the Hen Lab on <a href="https://www.hen-lab.com/research-src">BAND</a>, a neutron detector at <a href="https://www.jlab.org/">Jefferson Lab</a> in Newport News, VA collecting data to better understand the behavior of nucleons in short-range correlated pairs. I worked on developing a laser calibration system for the detector, measuring and calculating relevant parameters of the detector's photomultipliers and scintillator bars, and writing calibration software for data collection. I was also stationed at Jefferson Lab for the summer of 2018 working on BAND's assembly, installation, and setup.
