	<h2> Heavy-ion physics @ ALICE </h2>
	<div class="snapshot"> 
		<p class="para">
			I work with <a href="https://physics.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/barbara-jacak">Prof. Barbara Jacak's</a> group at UC Berkeley on projects for the <a href="https://alice-collaboration.web.cern.ch/">ALICE</a> collaboration. My current project is a measurement of energy-energy correlators in p-Pb collisions at ALICE. We see modifications to jet substructure in p-Pb collisions relative to p-p, which is quite striking. I showed preliminary results at Hard Probes 2024, where I delivered a talk on various EEC measurements at ALICE. I presented an extension of this p-Pb analysis (differential measurements in event activity, jet momentum, rapidity, etc.) in a talk at Quark Matter 2025.

		<p class="para">
			Before starting the PhD, I worked with the group for about six months prior to my Fulbright on software to streamline calibration for ALICE's Inner Tracking System.

			I also gave talks on the p-Pb EEC measurement at the 2024 APS April Meeting and the 2024 APS DNP conference. At the 2025 APS Group on Hadronic Physics meeting, I was invited to give a broad talk on EEC measurements. You can find my slides <a href="/stuff/GHP25_EECs.pdf">here</a>.

	<h2> Undergraduate research</h2>
	<div class="snapshot"> 
		<p class="para">
			<strong><em>Electrons for neutrinos. </em></strong> I spent two years working with <a href="https://www.hen-lab.com/">Prof. Or Hen's group </a> and the <a href='https://www.hen-lab.com/research-neutrino'>e4nu collaboration</a>. The collaboration uses electron scattering data to improve event generators for neutrino oscillation experiments. During the summer of 2019, I interned at Fermilab through the DOE SULI program and tested neutrino energy reconstruction techniques on GENIE simulations. Over 2020 and 2021, I analyzed electron-deuterium interactions for my undergraduate thesis to verify how well these methods work on the simplest nuclei.

		<p class="para">
			<strong><em>Axion detection. </em></strong> I worked for a semester in 2019 with Prof. Lindley Winslow's group on <a href="http://abracadabra.mit.edu/">ABRACADABRA</a>, a cryogenic search for axion cold dark matter. In 2021, I worked with <a href="https://katelinschutz.com/">Prof. Katelin Schutz</a> and others on a study of new methods for detecting axions in the galactic halo using radio telescopes. 
		</p>
		<p class="para">
			<strong><em>Backward Angle Neutron Detector. </em></strong> From 2017 to 2018, I worked with the Hen Lab on <a href="https://www.hen-lab.com/research-src">BAND</a>, a neutron detector at <a href="https://www.jlab.org/">Jefferson Lab</a> in Newport News, VA collecting data to better understand the behavior of nucleons in short-range correlated pairs. I worked on a laser calibration system for the detector, and measured various parameters of its photomultipliers and scintillator bars. I was stationed at Jefferson Lab for the summer of 2018 working on BAND's assembly, installation, and setup.
