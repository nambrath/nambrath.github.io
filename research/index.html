	<h1>Research</h1>
	<p class="sub">Here are some of the projects I've been a part of.</p>
	
	<h2> e4nu </h2>
	<div class="snapshot"> 
		<p class="para">
			I'm working with <a href="https://www.hen-lab.com/">Professor Or Hen's group </a> on the <a href='https://www.hen-lab.com/research-neutrino'>e4nu collaboration</a>. The collaboration is using electron data to improve energy reconstruction for neutrino oscillation experiments. I was at Fermilab during the summer of 2019 testing reconstruction techniques on GENIE event generator data. Currently, I'm analyzing electron-deuterium interactions to verify how well our methods work, and assessing how promising deuterium-based neutrino detectors might be.

	<h2> ABRACADABRA </h2>
	<div class="snapshot"> 
		<p class="para">
			I worked for a semester with Professor Lindley Winslow's group on <a href="http://abracadabra.mit.edu/">ABRACADABRA</a>, a cryogenic search for axion cold dark matter. I worked on characterizing parts of the current detector system as well as performing calculations for an upcoming new version of the detector.

	<h2> BAND </h2>
	<div class="snapshot"> 
		<p class="para">
			I worked with the Hen Lab on <a href="https://www.hen-lab.com/research-src">BAND</a>, a neutron detector at <a href="https://www.jlab.org/">Jefferson Lab</a> in Newport News, VA collecting data to better understand the behavior of nucleons in short-range correlated pairs. I worked on developing a laser calibration system for the detector, measuring and calculating relevant parameters of the detector's photomultipliers and scintillator bars, and writing calibration software for data collection. I was also stationed at Jefferson Lab for the summer of 2018 working on BAND's assembly, installation, and setup.

		<b>Physics community:</b> I'm an officer of MIT's Society of Physics Students. I've helped organize the Greater Boston Undergraduate Physics Conference, various faculty talks and lunches, career workshops, and outreach efforts to local schools. Outside of SPS, I've been an 8.03 tutor and an 8.044 grader. I'm also teaching a class on black holes for this year's <a href="https://esp.mit.edu/learn/Spark/index.html">Spark</a>.
