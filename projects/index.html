	<p class="sub">Here's an overview of some of the things I do with my time.</p>
	
	<h2> Physics </h2>

		<p class="para">
			<b>ABRACADABRA:</b> I'm currently working with Professor Lindley Winslow's group on <a href="http://abracadabra.mit.edu/">ABRACADABRA</a>, a cryogenic search for axion cold dark matter. I'm working on characterizing parts of the current detector system as well as performing calculations for an upcoming new version of the detector.

			<b>BAND:</b> Prior to this, I worked with Professor Or Hen's group on <a href="https://www.hen-lab.com/research-src">BAND</a>, a neutron detector at <a href="https://www.jlab.org/">Jefferson Lab</a> in Newport News, VA collecting data to better understand the behavior of nucleons in short-range correlated pairs. I worked on developing a laser calibration system for the detector, measuring and calculating relevant parameters of the detector's photomultipliers and scintillator bars, and writing calibration software for data collection. I was also stationed at Jefferson Lab for the summer of 2018 working on BAND's assembly, installation, and setup. I presented <a href="/stuff/poster.PNG">a poster</a> on my work at the 2018 APS Division of Nuclear Physics yearly meeting in Waikoloa, Hawaii.

			<b>Physics community:</b> I'm an officer of MIT's Society of Physics Students. I've helped organize the Greater Boston Undergraduate Physics Conference, various faculty talks and lunches, career workshops, and outreach efforts to local schools. Outside of SPS, I've been an 8.03 tutor and an 8.044 grader. I'm also teaching a class on black holes for this year's <a href="https://esp.mit.edu/learn/Spark/index.html">Spark</a>.

			<b>HackMIT:</b> I'm on the organizing committee for <a href="https://hackmit.org">HackMIT</a>, MIT's premier hackathon and one of the largest undergraduate hackathons in the country. I directed the marketing team for HackMIT 2018 and developed the event's branding and image while running a 7-person team. I also worked on marketing and logistics for <a href="blueprint.hackmit.org">Blueprint</a>, a hackathon for high schoolers run by our team. I designed materials for <a href="https://blueprint.hackmit.org/2018/">Blueprint 2018</a> and <a href="https://blueprint.hackmit.org/">Blueprint 2019</a>.

		<p class="para">
			<b>MIT Shakespeare Ensemble:</b> I have been the publicity designer for the <a href="http://ensemble.mit.edu/"> MIT Shakespeare Ensemble's</a> past five shows: <em>Rumors</em>, <em>Richard III</em>, <em>She Kills Monsters</em>, <em>Queen Lear</em>, and <em>Go Back for Murder</em>. I've designed posters and digital and print advertisements for each show.
