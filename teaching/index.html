	<h2 id="comp"> 8.S50: Computational Data Science in Physics </h2>
	<div class="snapshot"> 
		<p class="para">
			I co-taught recitations for this experimental subject at MIT over IAP 2021 with two other undergrads (Karna Morey '22 and Michal Szurek '22). The course was run by Professor Phil Harris. This was the Physics department's first academic offering that centers on computational approaches, and it was very exciting to be part of its development. We taught concepts in statistics, computation, and numerics, which were synthesized in three week-long physics data analysis projects. About 15 students completed the course, and I think it was a promising start for a class that will hopefully grow and flourish in coming years.

	<h2 id="blackholes"> Black Holes! </h2>
	<div class="snapshot"> 
		<p class="para">
			I developed this class with my very good friend and frequent co-teacher Emma Batson '20 after taking 8.033 (Relativity) at MIT. It introduces special and general relativity before diving into some of the fascinating features of black holes. We've taught this at every <a href="https://esp.mit.edu/learn/Spark">Spark</a> and <a href="https://esp.mit.edu/learn/Splash">Splash</a> since spring 2019 and it's been a huge hit with students from 7th to 12th grade. I also recorded a version of this which was used in the Honors Physics class at my old high school in spring 2020, after all classes became remote.

	<h2 id="sm"> The Standard Model! </h2>
	<div class="snapshot"> 
		<p class="para">
			Emma and I developed this class after taking 8.05 (Quantum Mechanics II) at MIT. It's an introduction to the world of particle physics and a primer on how all the different bits and pieces of the universe fit together, along with a brief introduction to some of the holes we have left to fill. We taught this in Splash 2019 and Splash 2020.

	<div class="snapshot"> 
		<p class="para">
			I developed this class with Emma as a 6-week course for <a href="https://esp.mit.edu/learn/HSSP/2020_Summer/catalog">HSSP 2020</a>. We took students from the basics of quantum mechanics all the way to quantum algorithms, and included a tutorial with a real live quantum computer. It was my first experience with teaching online (which was pretty exciting), and I'm proud to say the kids had a lot of fun. We had some great conversations about linear algebra, the conquistadors, and what exactly constitutes a sandwich.

		<p class="para">
			This is another 6-week course I developed for HSSP 2020, co-taught with Ashika Verma '22. Each week, we picked a different scientific topic to discuss, and described major developments over the last century. I taught three of the six weeks, and both I and the students learned a lot in the process. We experimented with online group worksheets, anonymous questions, and some other fun pedagogical tools.
