        <p class="para">
            I'm a third-year PhD student and <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/" target="_blank">NSF Graduate Research Fellow</a> at the <a href="https://physics.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">UC Berkeley Department of Physics</a>. I'm studying heavy-ion physics with <a href="https://physics.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/barbara-jacak" target="_blank">Barbara Jacak's</a> research group.

            I'm a former <a href="https://cies.org/" target="_blank">Fulbright-Nehru scholar</a>. I spent nine months studying collective neutrino oscillations at <a href="https://www.tifr.res.in/" target="_blank">TIFR</a> in Mumbai. In addition to the physics, I got to learn Hindi, travel around India, and lay the ground for some life-long international friendships.

            I graduated from <a href="https://web.mit.edu/" target="_blank">MIT</a> in 2021, where I majored in physics and mathematics and minored in French. I worked on a few projects supervised by <a href="https://www.hen-lab.com/" target="_blank">Or Hen</a>, <a href="https://www.jlab.org/news/releases/studying-small-learn-big" target="_blank">Dien Nguyen</a>, <a href="https://blogs.gwu.edu/axelschmidt/" target="_blank">Axel Schmidt</a>, <a href="http://www.lions.odu.edu/~lweinste" target="_blank">Larry Weinstein</a>, <a href="http://winslow.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Lindley Winslow</a>, and <a href="http://katelinschutz.com/" target="_blank">Katelin Schutz</a>. I also worked closely with <a href=https://mta.mit.edu/person/claire-conceison" target="_blank">Claire Conceison</a> and <a href="https://history.mit.edu/people/catherine-clark/" target="_blank">Catherine Clark</a> to produce an English translation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanny_Britt" target="_blank">Fanny Britt's</a> play <em>Hurlevents</em>. See <a href="../classes/index.html">this page</a> for a full list of my undergraduate coursework.

            In addition to particle physics, I enjoy good food, funky basslines, literature in translation, and stopping to photograph every flower I see. I've also hidden an easter egg somewhere on this website üê£
