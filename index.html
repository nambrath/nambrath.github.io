		<ul>
			<li> studying and working from home (or rather, trying my best). </li>
			<li> working on an analysis of neutrino energy reconstruction and another analysis of electron-deuterium interactions. </li>
			<li> consuming all the Media I can in this time of Quarantine (send me recommendations for books, movies, music, etc!). </li>
			<li> learning to make lunch on a really tight turnaround because I didn't budget for this when I picked classes. </li>
