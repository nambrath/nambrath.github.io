				I'm a third-year PhD student and <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/" target="_blank">NSF Graduate Research Fellow</a> at the <a href="https://physics.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">UC Berkeley Department of Physics</a>. I'm working in <a href="https://physics.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/barbara-jacak" target="_blank">Barbara Jacak's</a> research group on studies of jet substructure in heavy-ion physics.

				Before starting at Berkeley, I was a <a href="https://cies.org/" target="_blank">Fulbright-Nehru scholar</a> at <a href="https://www.tifr.res.in/" target="_blank">TIFR</a> in Mumbai. Prior to that, I was an undergraduate at <a href="https://web.mit.edu/" target="_blank">MIT</a> where I majored in physics and mathematics.
